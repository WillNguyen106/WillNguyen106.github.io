                Beautiful style and design are important factors of an elegant boutique hotel. Lantana Hoi An Boutique Hotel follows the Mediterranean style, which brings an enlivening 
                feeling to the guests because of the radiant colors. From the welcome drinks made for the guests to the designs in each room, the interior and exterior of the hotel are 
                adorned with the brilliant shades of blue and green. One glance at Lantana on a moonlit night, those who are passing by will not be able to take their eyes off the star-like 
                beauty of the building. The distinctiveness of Lantana is the vintage decorative telephone in every room, adding the indispensable feature of Hoi An Ancient Town to the modern 
                Mediterranean room's architecture. Lantana presents itself to the world with the look of a box-shaped building full of wonders. The hotel is named after the Lantana flower, 
                and the front of the building is decorated with the same colorful flowers which give the hotel its lively aura. One trip to the hotel and a stranger will become a fan of it just 
                by admiring the charmingly ornamental coat Lantana wears.
