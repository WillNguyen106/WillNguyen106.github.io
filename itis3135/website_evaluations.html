                </h3>
                <p>
                    Best Buy is a provider of consumer technology products and service.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Contrast: The constrast on this page is appropropriate. They use white and blue as a main color and it is really to read. Not too bright or too dark.</li>
                        <li>Repetition: This page is consistent. All the word in every section has the same font-size, font-style. The title in every product also has the same color and font-size.</li>
                        <li>Alignment: This page has a perfect alignment. They are lined up in the same row and column. It looks very clear and easy to read.</li>
                        <li>Proximity: Every category are grouped and have space out so it does not feel cramped. </li>

                    <a href="https://www.ncco.org">Bad website: New Century Champer Orchestra</a>
                </h3>
                <p>
                    New Century Champer Orchestra is an art organization where customer can find information about the latest events,
                    purchase tickets, and make donation.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Contrast: The constrast on this page is inappropriate, especially the pink color is really bright and it hurts my eye.</li>
                        <li>Repetition: A couple of thing are not consistent on this page. The size of words are smaller if you roll down from top to bottom of the Page
                            and it is hard to read. The size should be repead</li>
                        <li>Alignment: The page does not have a good alignment. the part "UP NEXT:" does not line up with the other part in the same section.
                            Other thing is 2 buttons "Donate" and "Subscribe" do not line up in the same line.
                        </li>
                        <li>Proximity: I do not see any products or scheduling on this page so I do not think they have proximity. The only thing I can think of
                            is "Donate" and "Subscribe" should be group in only 2 buttons. They have 2 buttons of "Donate" and 2 buttons of "Subscribe". </li>
                    </ul>
