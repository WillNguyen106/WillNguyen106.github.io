                <p><strong>I, <a href="introduction.html">Will. Nguyen</a>, agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my SEMESTER 2022, ITIS 3135  with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen.</strong></p>
                        
                <p><strong>I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world, and 
                            will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.</strong></p>
                        
                <p><strong>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, 
                        failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</strong></p>
                        
                <p><strong>I also understand that given the structure and content of this class it is possible to find many examples online or even view my classmatesâ€™s code directly.</strong></p>
                        
                <p><strong>I swear that I will only use these resources to learn, and will not cut and paste code except where I have properly given credit 
                        (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates.</strong></p>
