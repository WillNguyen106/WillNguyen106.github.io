                    Hello, my name is William Nguyen. I am in the second semester of my junior year studying Computer Science at University of Charlotte
                    I would like to tell you a little bit about my background, my hobby and my goal. 
                    
                    I was born in a small city called Quy Nhon. Quy Nhon is located about 200 kilometers middle of Binh Dinh province in Vietnam. I spent 
                    my first 10 years of life in Quy Nhon. Then my parents decided to move into a bigger city called Sai Gon. When I was 20, I have moved 
                    to America for studying abroad. I love America as same as my country. My career will start in this country becasue there are so many
                    oppotunities for me to be successful in the future. I especially love computer and computer is my best friend that I need to pursue my
                    dream job which is software engineering. Nevertheless, to fully understand my best friend, it is not easy and will take a lot of time.<br>

                    <strong>Hobbies</strong>

                    I have so many interested hobbies such as hiking, playing game, reading book, bowling, shooting. But my best hobby is traveling. I love adventures
                    so I went to travel so many place in Vietnam that is one of the beautiful countries in the world. A land of staggering natural beauty and cultural 
                    complexities, of dynamic megacities and hill-tribe villages, Vietnam is both exotic and compelling. Please follow my blog if you are interested in
                    Vietnam and would love to know more about this country.
